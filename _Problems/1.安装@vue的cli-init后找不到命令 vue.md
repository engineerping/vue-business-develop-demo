尝试步骤:

## 1.安装@vue的cli-init后找不到命令 vue

sudo 重新安装之后,依然不行  
  
sudo npm install @vue/cli-init -g

+ @vue/cli-init@5.0.8

## 1. 怀疑是 nodejs 版本过低, 而当前所安装的工具版本都是新版本,从 log 看似乎不支持旧版本的 Nodjs 了.  
所以卸载掉为旧版本的 nodejs 所安装的 webpack 和 @vue/cli-init, 重新安装最新版本的 nodejs 和 @vue/cli-init.<br/>
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 % npm uninstall webpack -g
removed 78 packages in 1.304s
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 % npm uninstall @vue/cli-init -g
removed 249 packages in 2.293s
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 %

## 1. 以前用 nvm 安装 nodejs 的笔记见  


## 1. 用 nvm 切换 nodejs 版本 时又出现不能永久生效的问题,
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 % nvm list <br/>
->     v10.24.1
       v16.20.2
       v20.11.0
default -> 10 (-> v10.24.1)
iojs -> N/A (default)
unstable -> N/A (default)
node -> stable (-> v20.11.0) (default)
stable -> 20.11 (-> v20.11.0) (default)
lts/* -> lts/iron (-> v20.11.0)
lts/argon -> v4.9.1 (-> N/A)
lts/boron -> v6.17.1 (-> N/A)
lts/carbon -> v8.17.0 (-> N/A)
lts/dubnium -> v10.24.1
lts/erbium -> v12.22.12 (-> N/A)
lts/fermium -> v14.21.3 (-> N/A)
lts/gallium -> v16.20.2
lts/hydrogen -> v18.19.0 (-> N/A)
lts/iron -> v20.11.0
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 % nvm use 16.20.2
Now using node v16.20.2 (npm v8.19.4)
<br/>
(base) gcsp@gongchengshipdeMacBook-Pro v10.24.1 %

###### 问题:  
`nvm use 16.20.2` 命令虽然执行成功了,但是只在当前 shell 终端生效,  
打开新的终端,依然会是旧的 node version  
`node -v` 输出: v10.24.1 , 但我期待它输出 v16.20.2.
###### 解决方案:
MacOS 的终端中,执行这 2 个命令之后, 就全局切换成功了  
`nvm use 16.20.2`  
`nvm alias default 16.20.2` 

安装 webpack
`sudo npm install webpack -g`

输出: changed 78 packages in 3m

安装 @vue/cli-init  
sudo npm install @vue/cli-init -g

###### 结果还是找不到 vue 命令,   
修复步骤:  
卸载 `sudo npm uninstall webpack -g`  
卸载 `sudo npm uninstall @vue/cli-init -g`  
  
参考挂网 https://cli.vuejs.org/#getting-started  
重新安装 @vue/cli 而不是 @vue/cli-init  
命令: `sudo npm install @vue/cli -g`
输出:  
sudo npm install @vue/cli -g
